# QR-Generator

In this little Project i create with the qrcode - libary in python a Quick Response Code in a PNG - File.

First step is to run the code and in the termimal two questions will pop out:

1. "Please insert the Name of your file: "
2. "Please insert you Data or weblink: "

After you did insert the name of your file and weblink. The programm will create a QR - png file in the folder, in which your code is saved.

The png will look like a standard QR - Code (this QR-Code is my GutHub repository).
